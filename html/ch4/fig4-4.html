            <p align="left" class="photocaption">Fig 4.4. An aligned set of sequences
              coloured (A) according to amino acid physicochemical properties
              and (B) according to the degree of conservation at each position
              in the alignment. (A) allows conserved residues and residue groups
              to be spotted at a glance. (B) highlights the degree of conservation
              across the entire alignment. Clearly, by bringing similar residues
              into vertical register, there is an increase in conservation, as
              denoted by the colour change from pale blue banding at the N-terminus
              to a virtually continuous dark blue band that continues to the
              C-terminus.</p></td>
