          <td> CINEMA (Colour INteractive Editor for Multiple Alignments) is a 
            tool for alignment construction, modification and visualisation. In 
            addition to its advantage of allowing interactive alignment over the 
            Web, CINEMA provides links to the primary data sources, thereby giving 
            access to up-to-date sequences and alignments. The program accepts 
            any number of sequences of any length, which may be loaded in various 
            ways. 
            <p > By default, alignments are coloured according to intuitive residue 
              property groups. Nevertheless, menu options allow user-specification 
              of residue colours (and hence residue groups) and to swap between 
              different colouring alternatives. Flexible colouring facilitates 
              the identification of core conserved regions of alignments and especially 
              of key motifs that may be associated with the structure or function 
              of the protein. </p>
            <p>The program offers various &quot;pluglets&quot;: <em>e.g.,</em> 
              dotplots, CLUSTALW, a 3D backbone viewer, BLAST, <em>etc.</em>.

          <td>JalView has the advantage of being available as both a downloadable 
            application and an applet online. The application offers a CLUSTALW 
            plug-in, performs Smith Waterman pairwise alignment, and is able to 
            calculate and draw UPGMA and NJ trees based on percent identity distances.
