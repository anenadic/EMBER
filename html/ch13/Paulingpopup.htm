<p>&quot;Let us propose that there is 
  a surface region on the. .. sickle cell anemia hemoglobin molecule which is 
  absent in the normal molecule and which has a configuration complementary to 
  a different region of the surface of the hemoglobin molecule.. . .Under the 
  appropriate conditions [as in low oxygen or air pressure], then, the sickle 
  cell anemia hemoglobin molecules might be capable of interacting with one another 
  at these sites sufficiently to cause at least a partial alignment of the molecules 
  within the cell, resulting in the erythrocyte's. .. membrane's being distorted 
  to accommodate the now relatively rigid structures within its confines.&quot;
