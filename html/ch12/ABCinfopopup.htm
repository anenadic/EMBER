<p>ABC transporters are membrane proteins 
  defined by a highly conserved domain, the ATP binding cassette (ABC). Powered 
  by ATP hydrolysis, different ABC transporters transport a wide range of substrates, 
  for example sugars, amino acids, hormones, mating factors, inorganic ions and 
  xenobiotic substances. Typically, two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide 
  binding domains (NBDs) are expressed. Hydrophobicity plots of a TMD often predict 
  6 TM helices, but there are notable exceptions such as MRP and TAP which have 
  extra predicted TM helices. </p>

  of the domain structure of an ABC transporter. 2 transmembrane domains (TMDs) 
  and 2 nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). The latter domains, though cytosolic, 
  are attached to the TMDs at the membrane, and drive the transport of the substrate 
  through ATP hydrolysis.</font></b></p>
<p>Though ABC transporters are made 
  up of four domains, these are often expressed as separate polypeptide chains. 
  For example MDR, MRP and CFTR proteins are functional as a monomer and are each 
  encoded by a single gene, but TAP is functional as a heterodimer of TAP1+2 and 
  is accordingly encoded by two genes. Other than the canonical 2 TMDs + 2 NBDs 
  structure, ABC transporters can have a homodimer of one NBD attached to the 
  TMDs rather than two different NBDs.</p>
